* Building out a Web API that deliveres random Trumpt phrases generated by a first and second order Markov model. *

GET /phraseFromFirstOrder - deliveres phrase generated by first order model. The code for generating the model can be found in the FirstOrderMarkov class.

GET /phraseFromSecondOrder - deliveres phrase generated by second order model. The code for generating the model can be found in the SecondOrderMarkov class.

The font end of this app utilizes React. User will have the function to toggle between generating a phrase from the first and second order models. 

I wrote a brief tutorial on the process that I went though to build this app on Medium. You can find the article here: https://medium.com/@emily_45402/markov-models-and-trump-tweets-91b0d3f0f1eb

Data for this project can be found in the data folder, this includes the original Trump tweet text that was mined from this site:
http://trumptwitterarchive.com/

It also includes csv file which is a version of the data that I 'cleaned' using python. This removes all special character aside from basic punctuation and lowercases all text. It also removes usernames from Donalds tweets since that isn't especially important to our Markov Models.
